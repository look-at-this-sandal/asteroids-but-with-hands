2024-10-08 - 4 hr: resumed work after life factors interfered AGAIN
= BLOCK 1 (pre-class work)
- referenced [youtube tutorial by 'Kaan Alpar'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELrMMv7D1wM) to further develop asteroid gimmick code
- established claw scene, got to work with coding the grabbing function based on [tutorial by Jean Makes Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4mVVx4njno)
- fully implemented reset scene function for testing purposes
- added temporary code to ensure big asteroids cannot be grabbed
- added temporary code to have medium and small asteroids have their positions set to the player ship's position when grabbed
- got to work with initial variables and work-in-progress state machine for claw (printing to console to determine when the state is switched)
- re-uploaded build to itch.io to reflect the version of the project at the end of this block

2024-10-01 - 3.5 hr: got back to work on project after other personal life factors got in way
- referenced [youtube tutorial by 'Kaan Alpar'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDpZ52Ulywg) to add movement for the player ship (controlled with arrow keys AND gamepad)
- imported temporary spaceship sprite and claw sprite assets made myself
- added multiple inputs for keyboard AND gamepad (with an additional dedicated "reset" button for testing purposes)
- got working screenwrap for player ship based on previously mentioned tutorial
- began working on the coding for the asteroids:
- asteroids now spawn in with random rotation, and wrap around the screen with a similar process to the player ship
- asteroid sizes defined as "LARGE", "MEDIUM", and "SMALL" with an enum function and variable
- future reference: look into using "Tween" node for handling the movement of the claw 

2024-09-24 - 2.5 hr: set up initial github repo in class
- learned how to use github a little bit using the provided tutorial, made the initial repo
- set up itch.io page for the project, made first html5 export of game
- learned how to make use of "pushing" and commands with gitbash
- set up trello board before class and finished it during last 10 minutes
